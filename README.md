# House-Price-Prediction


## Objective:

The project aims to support a US-based housing company, Surprise Housing, in its venture to enter the Australian market. Utilizing data analytics, the company seeks to buy properties below market value and sell them for a profit. A dataset from the Australian housing market has been collected to build a regression model employing regularization techniques. The goal is to predict the actual values of prospective properties and make informed investment decisions.

## Key Questions:

1. Identification of significant variables predicting house prices.
2. Evaluation of how well these variables describe house prices.
3. Determination of the optimal alpha values for Ridge and Lasso regression.
4. Handling scenarios when crucial predictor variables are absent and their implications on model performance.

## Business Goal:

To model house prices based on available independent variables, providing insights to guide the company's strategy in the Australian market.
Enabling management to understand pricing dynamics and focus on areas yielding higher returns.

# Questions and Approach

## 1. Optimal Alpha Values (Ridge and Lasso):

Determination of optimal alpha values for Ridge and Lasso regression models.
The understanding model changes upon doubling alpha values.
Identifying the most significant predictor variables after alpha adjustment.

## 2. Ridge vs. Lasso Regression Selection:

Based on previous analysis, choosing between Ridge and Lasso regression models.
Justification for model selection considering their effectiveness in feature selection and interpretability.

## 3. Handling Missing Important Predictor Variables:

Addressing the scenario where the top five important predictor variables from Lasso are absent in new data.
Identifying the new top five significant predictor variables excluding the missing ones.

## 4. Ensuring Model Robustness and Generalizability:

Strategies to ensure the model avoids overfitting and remains generalizable.
Discussing implications of model robustness on its accuracy and reliability for business decisions.

# Business Impact
The resulting regression model will empower Surprise Housing to comprehend the pricing dynamics in the Australian housing market. It will guide strategic decisions, optimize investment strategies, and foster a deeper understanding of market trends, ultimately maximizing returns on property investments.
